Draggable JS Query Builder
==============
This is a proof-of-concept attempt at a JavaScript if-statement tree builder **with drag-and-drop support**. There has been various libraries that allows for a visual approach for building complex queries (hats off to [Knockout.js Query Builder] (http://kindohm.github.io/knockout-query-builder/)), but none of them supports dragging conditions around to alter the tree structure. Thanks to the new [HTML5 Drag-and-Drop API] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Drag_and_drop), this task has become much easier. 

Preliminarily tested in Firefox and Chrome; comments are welcome.
