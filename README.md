jsQueryBuilder
==============
# Overview
This is a proof-of-concept attempt at a draggable JavaScript if-statement tree builder. There has been various libraries that allows for a visual approach for building complex queries (hats off to Knockout.js Query Builder (http://kindohm.github.io/knockout-query-builder/)), but none of them supports dragging conditions around to alter the tree structure. Thanks to the new HTML5 Drag-and-Drop API (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Drag_and_drop), this task has become easier. 
Preliminarily tested in Firefox and Chrome; comments are welcome.
